# CH32V003-drives-HX711-weighing-load-cell
HX711 load cell implementation 
HX711.s uses hardcoded offset value and was the base code on which other codes will be developed. In this I took out the uart read out of the measured value with uart while the loadcell is not loaded. The unloaded value is used as offset and is hard coded into the code later. The off set is subtracted from the loaded cell value to get the actual weight. After calculating offset , i placed 10gm wheel blancing weight and noted the value. took another reading with 20g wheel balancing weight. 20gm reading - 10gm reading gave me the ADC output for 10 gm. this was about 16000. dividing 1600/10 gives 1600 ADC counts (HX711) for 1 gram weight.So 1/1600 will give weight for 1 ADC count .ie 0.000625gm. Multiplying HX711 output with 0.000625 after subtracting offset will give the weight. In HX711_ver0 i have implemented a REZERO switch which will automatically calculate the offset with tare empty on pressing the switch. This is useful as the cheap aliexpress loadcell drifts after sometime causing biased values. On pressing rezeo button implemented on PC5 the offset can be corrected before making a measurement.
